# VidSizeCalc

VidSizeCalc is a simple web-based calculator designed to estimate the file size of videos encoded with H.264 and H.265 codecs. It allows users to input video duration, resolution, bitrate, framerate, and chroma subsampling, and provides an estimated output size for both codecs.

## Features

- Input video duration in hours and minutes.
- Prefilled fields for common resolutions (1920x1080) and chroma subsampling (4:2:0).
- Calculates and displays estimated video file sizes for H.264 and H.265 codecs.
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Built with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
